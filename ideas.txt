1st idea: treat radar frame as a vector going through fully-connected layers
problem: reward comes a few frames after the action => need to link it: more frames as input? problem of size
1st fix: change num frames
2nd frames: for a certain num of frames ( <= num frames input), same action

2nd idea: add experience replay

3rd idea: imitation learning (real players show him how to play a little and see if the agent can learn from that)

and wait for the reviews
